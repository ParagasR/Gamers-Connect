# Gamers-Connect

## Description

In this project, we created a full-stack blog application for gamers to connect and talk about their favorite games. The user is presented with features such as a login/sign-up, a profile page where the user can upload a profile picture and fill out a custom bio, and a blog feature that allows the user to post about games and also leave comments on other blog posts.
